# Short and Long-term Pattern Discovery Over Large-Scale Geo-Spatiotemporal Data
This repo contains all the codes and sample files for the "Short and Long-term Pattern Discovery Over Large-Scale Geo-Spatiotemporal Data" paper 


## Short-term Pattern Discovery


## Long-term Pattern Discovery


## Data Pre-processing Steps


## Requirements 
The only requirement is ```Python```, version 2.7 is recommended. 


## How to Run
* __Extracting Short-term Patterns__: there are multiple steps to extract short-term patterns as follows:
  * __Removing Redundant Traffic Events__: 
  * __Finding Child-Parent Relations__: 
  * __Creating Sequences of Relations__: 
  * __Extracting Tree Structures from Sequences__: 
  * __Mining Frequent Tree Patterns__: 


* __Extracting Long-term Patterns__:


## Dataset
A large-scale dataset of traffic and weather event data is used as input. Check [here](https://smoosavi.org/datasets/lstw) for the latest version of such a dataset. The data comes in form of a single CSV file. We ingest the same data as input to both short and long-term pattern discovery processes.
